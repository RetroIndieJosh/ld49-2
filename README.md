# Train Tilt

A game in Godot by Joshua McLean

Developed in ~8 hours for the second half of Compo because I had a change of
heart on game concept - mostly because I envisioned this one as complete
whereas the first idea was heading nowhere fast.

## Concept

Get the train to the end as fast as possible.

The train slows down if its edges touch the track.

Your goal: Balance weight on the train (including your own).

Some objects are heavier than others, and distance from the center matters.

## Controls

A/D keys, arrows, d-pad, or left stick: move player
space, key X, gamepad bottom button: jump
alt, key C, gamepad left button: grab box (hold) or throw held box

In loving memory of Charlie, my furry companion who left us suddenly and far
too soon.

Special thanks to my wife, Kate, for being super supportive on this maddeningly
difficult weekend. She continues to keep me going even when I don't think I
can.
