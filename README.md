# Train Tilt

A game in Godot by Joshua McLean

Developed in under 9 hours for the second half of Compo because I had a change
of heart on game concept - mostly because I envisioned this one as complete
whereas the first idea was heading nowhere fast.

It's a bit wonky, but I hope you'll get some fun out of it.

## Concept

Get the train to the end as fast as possible.

The train slows down if its edges touch the track. If it slows too much, game
over!

Your goal: Balance weight on the train (including your own) to get the fastest
speed possible.

Distance from the center matters.

## Controls

- Move: A/D keys, arrows, d-pad, or left stick
- Jump: space, key X, gamepad bottom button
- Grab/Throw: alt, key C, gamepad left button (hold to grab)
- Pause: Esc, Pause/Start/+
- Quit (after pausing): key Q, Back/Share/-

In loving memory of Charlie, my furry companion who left us suddenly and far
too soon.

Special thanks to my wife, Kate, for being super supportive on this maddeningly
difficult weekend. She continues to keep me going even when I don't think I
can.
