# Train Tilt

A game in Godot by Joshua McLean

Developed in under 9 hours for the second half of Compo because I had a change
of heart on game concept - mostly because I envisioned this one as complete
whereas the first idea was heading nowhere fast.

It's a bit wonky, but I hope you'll get some fun out of it.

## Concept

Deliver the cargo as quickly as possible - and as much of it as you can save.

The train slows down if it touches the track. If it's too slow, game over!

Balance weight on the train (including your own) for maximum speed.

Distance from the center matters!

What's the highest level you can reach? And the most boxes delivered?

## Controls

- Move: A/D keys, arrows, d-pad, or left stick
- Jump: space, key X, gamepad bottom button
- Grab/Throw: alt, key C, gamepad left button (hold to grab - you will also auto-grab anything that falls on your head)
- Pause: Esc, Pause/Start/+
- Quit (after pausing): key Q, Back/Share/-

## Known Issues

You can get trapped/buried under too many boxes. Try jumping or grabbing and
throwing to dig your way out. Otherwise you may have to wait and hope.

In loving memory of Charlie, my furry companion who left us suddenly and far
too soon.

Special thanks to my wife, Kate, for being super supportive on this maddeningly
difficult weekend. She continues to keep me going even when I don't think I
can.
