# Train Tilt

## Ideal

- advance levels
        - spawn boxes more often 
        - faster angular tilt
        - wider train bed
- only count weight of things on train (not in air)
- train angular acceleration (slow down getting closer to track)
- jump landing more heavily influences tilt? so jumping up and down does more
- less floaty jump
- how to handle box on box? (grabbing box underneath)

## Wish

- rotate player/boxes to match floor (up = floor normal)
- hardest levels have no walls (can walk off)
- web build
- animate wheels
- high scores
        - fastest time (per level)
        - highest cargo count (per level)
        - highest total cargo count

## CRITICAL BUGS

- player can get stuck with box landing on them
        - two boxes or box just outside detector
