# LD 49 Attempt 2

## Minimum Playable

- victory screen
- game over (fall onto track or too slow)
- countdown to level start

## Ideal

- player jump
- train angular acceleration (slow down getting closer to track)
- jump landing more heavily influences tilt? so jumping up and down does more
- title screen
- multiple levels
    - change width of train bed (higher values = harder)
- music
- how to handle box on box? (grabbing box underneath)

## Wish

- rotate player/boxes to match floor (up = floor normal)
- hardest levels have no walls (can fall off)
- sounds
- web build
- larger player and train scale

## CRITICAL BUGS

- player can get stuck with box landing on them
        - two boxes or box just outside detector
