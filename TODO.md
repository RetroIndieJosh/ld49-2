- throw held box
- progress display (top or bottom of screen)
- timer
- timer display
- victory screen

## Ideal

- title screen
- multiple levels
    - change width of train bed (higher values = harder)
- player jump
- what to do about boxes pushed against edge?
- music

## Wish

- sounds
- web build
- larger player and train scale

## CRITICAL BUGS

        - use a second up detector to push on jump
